# Fred

Fred is a collection of common CSS patterns for websites.

You can build a custom package by running `grunt <module-name> <other-module-name>`. Defaults to all.

Grunt will make a `dist/fred.scss`, and compiled `dist/fred.css` for your project.



## Installation

Run `npm install` to set up all Fred's dependencies
